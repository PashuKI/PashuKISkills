# PashuKISkills
# This plugin adds "Skills" to the game.
# With the plugin, Every player can collect mining/farming/combat/woodcutting EXP which counts how much blocks/mobs the player harvested/killed so far, Depends on what block/mob.
# For example, If a player mined a diamond ore, The player gets 20 mining EXP, However, If the player mined a stone block, The player get 2 mining EXP, Basicly the same with farming & woodcutting.
# In combat, You kill mobs to get combat EXP, Depends on what mob. (Exept sheeps, Cows, Chickens, Pigs, Rabbits and mushroom cows. They give farming EXP when the killed).
# If the player reaches a high EXP amount on his skill, The player can get double or even triple drops if he mines a block (Depends on his luck and his EXP amount). If the player reaches a high EXP amount and kills an animal, It gets Exprience orbs instead.
# Additionaly, There are admin-only commands who lets the admins change/see the active score of their target player.
# Have fun :D
